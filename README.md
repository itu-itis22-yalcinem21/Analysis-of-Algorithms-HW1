# Analysis of Algorithms – Homework 1

This repository contains the implementation for **Homework 1** of the *BLG335E – Analysis of Algorithms* course at Istanbul Technical University. The assignment involves analyzing the performance of various sorting and searching algorithms on large tweet datasets related to ITU’s graduation event.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `bin/`: Compiled executable files.
- `data/`: Input datasets for tweet statistics.
- `include/`: Header files containing function declarations and data structures.
- `lib/`: External libraries (e.g., Munit test framework).
- `src/`: Main C++ source files (`main.cpp`, `sort.cpp`, `metrics.cpp`, `utilities.cpp`).
- `tests/`: Unit test implementations.
- `LICENSE`: License file for the repository.
- `Makefile`: To build, run, and test the project easily via terminal.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort (ascending & descending)
- Binary Search on tweet statistics
- Threshold Count for retweets or favorites
- Full analysis on different dataset sizes and permutations

## 🧪 Build & Run Instructions
